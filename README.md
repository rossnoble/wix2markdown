# Wix2Markdown

## Raison D'Ãªtre

If you've ever had the misfortune of having to export content from a Wix website,
you might appreciate why this script exists. Simply put, Wix does not make it easy
for people to move their site content to other platforms.

While working on a project for a client, I was tasked with porting blog posts and
other content to a static site running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). This
helped me grabbed the blog posts via the RSS feed and convert them to flat
Markdown files.

## TODO

* Convert to a ruby gem
* Add a CLI for ease of user
* Write tests
* Add a general purpose scraper
